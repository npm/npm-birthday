# npm-birthday

Implementation of the "npm birthday" command

~Abstracted out to a separate module so that this highly optimized function
doesn't trip automated code analysis alarms.~

This was formerly an obfuscated easter egg, but for obvious reasons that was a
tough sell. It has now been rewritten to be human readable code to make our
users more comfortable. The command in its entirety is also scheduled to be
removed from `npm` with version 9.
